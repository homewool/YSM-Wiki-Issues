## How to Install the Mod

The latest release version of the mod is: `2.6.5`

The mod works on:

<Card title="Version 2.6.5" icon="icon-park-outline:tag">

- Forge: `1.20.1`
- Fabric: `1.21.1` `1.20.1`
- NeoForge: `1.21.1` `26.1.2`

</Card>

<Card title="Version 2.4.1" icon="icon-park-outline:tag">

- Forge: `1.20.1`, `1.19.2`, `1.18.2`, `1.16.5`
- Fabric: `1.21.1`, `1.21`, `1.20.1`, `1.19.2`, `1.18.2`, `1.16.5`
- NeoForge: `1.21.1`, `1.21`

</Card>

Due to review issues on CurseForge, the YSM mod has been removed from it. Please download the latest version on Modrinth:

- Modrinth: <https://modrinth.com/mod/yes-steve-model/versions>

A major reconstruction was made in version `1.2.0`. Most new models cannot be loaded in version `1.1.5` and below.

We always expect that you can use the latest version. You can check the version by looking at the texts on the lower left corner in the Select Model menu:

::: warning

- Please distinguish the difference between `Forge` and `Fabric` when downloading!

Watch some walkthrough videos in case you really don't know how to install the mod.

## How to Get Models

Most Chinese creators post model demonstration videos on Bilibili. You can search related keywords on Bilibili to find the model you want.
Also, some creators post models (either free or paid) on AFDIAN. There is a free model collection maintained by enthusiasts in the YSM community as well.
Some creators post models on Planet Minecraft.

## I Can't Find My Model

If you have installed your model following the instructions above, but still cannot find it, please check the following:

- Did you actually have the mod installed?
- Did you have the latest version (2.6.5) of the mod installed? Most new models requires mod version 2.2.2 or above. Version 1.1.5 is no longer supported!
- Were you in multiplayer? Only the OP can install models on a server.
- Have you executed the command `/ysm model reload` to reload the models?
- If you were playing for the first time, and have quite a lot of models installed, you could be in a situation where only the default model is available after reloading. Please wait for a while as the mod is building cache for your models, after which the models should show up. (Same for multiplayer)

## It Always Renders the Vanilla Player Model

## It Says "Unsupported ysm format version"

![lowversion.jpg](/img/notes/wiki/faq/faq_lowversion_e4bd1c9a.jpg)

If you encountered this, please check if your YSM is up to date (the latest version is 2.6.5). If not, please update.

If it is up to date, please contact the model author.

## Mod crashes on startup; Java reports EXCEPTION_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION

After version 2.2.2, the YSM mod uses the **AVX instruction set** to improve performance. This instruction set requires a CPU released **after 2010** to run. Older CPUs will trigger the `EXCEPTION_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION` error.

You can either play a YSM version **before 2.2.2**, or upgrade your computer hardware if conditions permit.

## Can I Play YSM on Bedrock Edition or NetEase Edition

Currently YSM for NetEase Edition is available. You can search `是，史蒂夫模型` in the store to download it for free!

![saveimage_1738309430.jpg](/img/notes/wiki/faq/faq_saveimage_1738309430_e0761572.jpg)

::: warning
Please note that the NetEase Edition and the Java Edition do not share the same community.

In the case that you encounter any problems when playing the NetEase Edition, please do not give feedback to the Java Edition group. Vice versa, issues on Java Edition should not be sent to the NetEase Edition group either.

## Can I Play YSM on My Phone

Yes, starting from version 2.5.2, this mod supports mobile gameplay, but a compatible launcher needs to be installed.

Currently supported launchers are:

- [Fold Craft Launcher](https://github.com/FCL-Team/FoldCraftLauncher)
- [Zalith Launcher](https://github.com/ZalithLauncher/ZalithLauncher)
- [Zalith Launcher 2](https://github.com/ZalithLauncher/ZalithLauncher2)

If you are using the correct launcher but still cannot play normally, please update your launcher to the latest version.

- If you are the developer of the Android version of Minecraft JE Launcher...

  Due to Android's permission restrictions, YSM requires a special environment variable `MOD_ANDROID_RUNTIME` to run properly. It is used to store the native files needed for YSM's operation. Below is the compatibility description:

  ::: demo-wrapper title="MOD_ANDROID_RUNTIME Environment Variable Configuration Instructions"

  ## Configuration Requirements

  The `MOD_ANDROID_RUNTIME` environment variable must point to a directory in the same namespace as `libjvm.so`.

  ## Technical Background

  Android 7.0+ introduced the native library namespace isolation mechanism. The `.so` library files of the Yes Steve Model mod need to be in the same namespace as the JVM runtime library to load correctly.

  ## Supported Launcher Configuration Examples

  #### Fold Craft Launcher
  - Environment variable path: `/data/user/0/com.tungsten.fcl/app_runtime_mod`
  - JVM runtime library path: `/data/user/0/com.tungsten.fcl/app_runtime/java/jre17/lib/server/libjvm.so`

  #### Zalith Launcher
  - Environment variable path: `/data/user/0/com.movtery.zalithlauncher/app_runtime_mod`
  - JVM runtime library path: `/data/user/0/com.movtery.zalithlauncher/runtimes/Internal-17/lib/server/libjvm.so`

  ## Reference Documents

  - [Android Native Library Namespaces Documentation](https://source.android.com/docs/core/permissions/namespaces_libraries)

You can also choose to play the NetEase Edition.
